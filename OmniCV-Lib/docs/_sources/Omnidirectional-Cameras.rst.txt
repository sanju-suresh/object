Omni directional cameras
************************

Omnidirectional cameras refer to cameras that have a larger field of view than the normal cameras (more than 180 |deg| and ideally 360 |deg|). This includes cameras with horizontal 360 |deg| field of view(FOV) and cameras with FOV spanning a 360 |deg| horizontal and more than 90 (ideally 180) vertical field of view(FOV).[1] Ever imagined how we can get a 360 |deg| field of view? 

An omnidirectional camera (from Omni, meaning all) is a camera with a 360 |deg| field of view in the horizontal plane, or with a visual field that covers a hemisphere or (approximately) the entire sphere. There are designs proposed to achieve a 360 |deg| degree field of view.

1. Dioptric cameras with a single lens
--------------------------------------

Cameras which use an only special lens to refract light such that the field of view is more than 90 |deg| vertically and 360 |deg| horizontally. One common example of such type of camera is a fisheye camera.

2. Catadioptric cameras
-----------------------

Cameras that use a combination of the lens (to refract light) and mirrors (to reflect light) with a normal camera to generate 360 |deg| horizontal and more than 90 |deg| vertical field of view.[1]
Figure 2 is an example of a catadioptric camera.

3. Camera with two lens
-----------------------

Cameras that consist of two fisheye cameras placed facing away from each other and each one has a FOV that can span more than a hemisphere. Images from both cameras are stitched to get the full 360 |deg| image. This configuration is commonly used in the 360 |deg| cameras available in the market.

4. Polydioptric cameras
-----------------------

Cameras which consist of more than two cameras with overlapping field of view.[1] One example of such type of camera is the throwing camera "panono"[5]. Image from all the cameras is captured at the same time and then stitched to get the full 360 |deg| image.
